					Kaveman Bar & Grill was established in 2008 by Kyle Corwin. We are still owned and operated by Kyle and his family. We are located in Lafayette, Indiana on the Wabash River and have some out-door seating for guests to enjoy the beautiful sunsets and warm fire. Our namesake comes from a nickname given to Kyle during school because of his full beard. We have adopted the caveman diet with our menu and provide a wide variety of wild meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. We offer daily lunch and dinner specials, as well as; special events. Special events include live music, trivia night, karaoke, and much more. </p>
				<p>
					Our mission is to provide our guests with a place to relax and enjoy a wonderful meal. We have a superb bar area with several beers on tap, and billiards. We also have a separate family area that insures a private space for families to spend time together. In the family area we have some arcade games that are free to play for our guests. Both area’s have large screen TV’s that will have current games on. We have committed ourselves to providing excellent service to our guests. Our excellent staff are well trained and are here to assist you with any issues you have. We have hired a top-notch chief that has assisted Kyle with creating a menu that is out of this world.</p>
